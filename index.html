            Hello and welcome to my page! As you can tell, my name is Wendy. I
            currently work in Quality Assurance at a Biopharmaceutilcal company
            in RTP. I have a 3 year old Golden Retriever named Bailey who loves
            to play fetch. I was born and raised in Boston, Massachusetts (Go
            Pats/Celtics/Red Sox/Bruins!) so it was really eye-opening when I
            first moved to North Carolina. Prior to my move to NC, I lived and
            worked in Copenhagen, Denmark. My company sent me there for a
            temporary work assignment and it was definitely the most memorable
            and best experience I've ever had; it was amazing to be able to
            immerse myself in a totally different country and culture.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm an amateur foodie so I really miss all the yummy food in Boston.
            One thing that I don't think I'll ever get used to is the
            humidity... especially the summer time! It's unbearable to be
            outside - even for my outdoor loving pupper. In my free time I like
            to play video games (mostly PC, or Nintendo Switch), experiment with
            different food recipies with my boyfriend, and I love to travel! I
            also love going to EDM events and festivals with my friends from
            Boston.
